# My configuration files

Here is the repo of all my configuration files for terminal applications, including vim, tmux, ranger and more.

If you want to reproduce this config, you may simply clone the repository in your home directory.
In you only want to use a part of it, you may clone it in a directory and use symlinks.

## My vim configuration

I have most of my vim configuration in my `.vimrc`, but :

 - i try to put language-specific configurations in `~/.vim/after/syntax/<syntax_name>.vim`
 - i used to store part of my config in `~/.vim/commands`, but now only `~/.vim/commands/alarms.vim` is used
 - i have some plugins that i made myself and that are not really documented. It is because i'm the only one to use them
